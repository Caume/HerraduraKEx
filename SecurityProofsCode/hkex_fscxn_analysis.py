hkex_fscxn_analysis.py — Formal proof that replacing fscx_revolve with
fscx_revolve_n in HKEX key generation does NOT fix the classical break.

The question
------------
The existing HKEX uses fscx_revolve for public-key generation:

    C  = fscx_revolve(A,  B,  i)
    C2 = fscx_revolve(A2, B2, i)

The key derivation already uses fscx_revolve_n:

    sk = fscx_revolve_n(C2, B, N, r) ⊕ A   (Alice)
       = fscx_revolve_n(C,  B2, N, r) ⊕ A2  (Bob)   where N = C ⊕ C2

Would using fscx_revolve_n also in the public-key step close the break?

The answer: No — unconditionally.
The proof
---------
The break originates from the FSCX operator being GF(2)-linear.  This causes
the fundamental identity  S_n = 0  (sum of all powers of M vanishes), which
in turn causes private parameters to cancel from the shared-key expression.
Using fscx_revolve_n introduces an additive nonce term, but that term must
come from one of only two possible sources:

  Case (a) PUBLIC nonce — the nonce is known to Eve.
    Eve adjusts her formula to absorb the nonce contribution, which is still
    computable from public information.  The break survives.

  Case (b) PRIVATE nonce — e.g. nonce = B (Alice's private value).
    Now the nonce term does NOT cancel in the sk_alice - sk_bob difference,
    so  sk_alice ≠ sk_bob  for random independent keys.
    Correctness is destroyed.

There is no third option.  Any nonce is either public (Eve can use it too)
or private (it breaks correctness).  The GF(2)-linearity of M is what makes
these the only two cases, and no variant of nonce injection can escape the
dilemma without introducing a non-linear primitive.

Algebraic detail — Case (a)
---------------------------
Let  Φ_a  be any known (public) nonce.  Then:

    C  = fscx_revolve_n(A,  B,  Φ_a, i)
       = M^i·A + S_i·(M·B ⊕ Φ_a)

Solving for A:
    A  = M^r·C ⊕ M^{r+1}·S_i·B ⊕ M^r·S_i·Φ_a           (*)

Substituting (*) into Alice's sk expression
(sk_a = M^r·C2 + S_r·M·B ⊕ S_r·N ⊕ A, N = C⊕C2):

    sk_a = S_{r+1}·(C⊕C2)
         ⊕  (S_r·M + M^{r+1}·S_i)·B          ← = S_n·B = 0
         ⊕  M^r·S_i·Φ_a

         = S_{r+1}·(C⊕C2)  ⊕  M^r·S_i·Φ_a

Both terms are computable from public information (C, C2, Φ_a).  Eve recovers
sk exactly as before, just with a known offset.

Algebraic detail — Case (b)
---------------------------
Let each party use their own private B as the nonce:

    C  = fscx_revolve_n(A,  B,  B,  i)
       = M^i·A + S_i·(M+I)·B
    C2 = fscx_revolve_n(A2, B2, B2, i)
       = M^i·A2 + S_i·(M+I)·B2

By the same derivation:
    sk_a = S_{r+1}·(C⊕C2)  ⊕  M^r·S_i·B
    sk_b = S_{r+1}·(C⊕C2)  ⊕  M^r·S_i·B2

    sk_a - sk_b = M^r·S_i·(B ⊕ B2)

This is zero only if B = B2 — impossible for independent random keys.
Correctness fails.

Root cause
----------
A DH-style exchange requires a function  f  such that:

    f(a, f(b, g)) = f(b, f(a, g))   [commutativity / shared-key equality]
    f(a, ·) is a one-way function    [security]

FSCX_REVOLVE satisfies the first condition by virtue of S_n = 0.  But S_n = 0
is *also* what makes f linear in its arguments and thus allows the classical
break.  These two properties — correctness by cancellation, and security
against a passive observer — are mutually exclusive under any GF(2)-linear
primitive:

    Correctness requires: private terms cancel from (sk_alice - sk_bob) → 0
    Security requires:    private terms remain in sk_alice

They cannot both hold simultaneously when every operation is a GF(2)-linear
map.  Adding a nonce via fscx_revolve_n does not escape this dilemma because
the nonce injection is itself a linear operation (XOR).

The only path to a secure DH-style construction is to replace the GF(2)-linear
FSCX primitive with a non-linear one — e.g. a function that does not satisfy
the superposition principle  f(A⊕X) = f(A)⊕f(X).

  The dilemma is inherent and cannot be resolved within the GF(2)-linear
  framework:

    PUBLIC  nonce → Eve absorbs it into her formula. Break survives.
    PRIVATE nonce → sk_a ≠ sk_b. Correctness is destroyed.

  Root cause: the fundamental identity  S_n = 0  (which M^{n/2}=I implies)
  causes private parameters to cancel from (sk_alice − sk_bob), making the
  scheme correct.  But that exact cancellation is also what collapses sk
  into a linear function of the public values.

  fscx_revolve_n is a linear operation (XOR injection). Adding a linear
  operation to a linear scheme does not introduce non-linearity.

  Fix requires: replacing the FSCX linear primitive with a non-linear one
  so that the function f(a, ·) is genuinely one-way — i.e., so that the
  "cancellation trick" that enables correctness cannot simultaneously be
  exploited to compute sk from public values alone.
