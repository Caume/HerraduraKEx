# Changelog

All notable changes to the Herradura Cryptographic Suite are documented here.

## [1.3] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- **`Herradura cryptographic suite.c`**: replaced fixed 64-bit integers with a
  `BitArray` type — a fixed-width bit string backed by a big-endian byte array —
  matching the Python and Go implementations. Default key size is now **256 bits**
  (`KEYBITS = 256`, `I_VALUE = 64`, `R_VALUE = 192`), controlled by a single
  `#define KEYBITS` at the top of the file. All four protocols (HKEX, HSKE, HPKS,
  HPKE) and the EVE bypass tests operate on `BitArray` operands.

  `BitArray` API:
  - `ba_rand`          — fill from `/dev/urandom`
  - `ba_xor` / `ba_xor_into` — bitwise XOR (out-of-place / in-place)
  - `ba_rol1` / `ba_ror1`    — rotate left/right by 1 bit (big-endian)
  - `ba_equal`         — constant-time-style `memcmp` equality
  - `ba_print_hex`     — zero-padded hex output
  - `ba_fscx`          — Full Surroundings Cyclic XOR
  - `ba_fscx_revolve`  — iterate FSCX n times
  - `ba_fscx_revolve_n` — nonce-augmented FSCX_REVOLVE (v1.1)

  Build: `gcc -O2 -o "Herradura cryptographic suite" "Herradura cryptographic suite.c"`

## [1.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- **`Herradura cryptographic suite.c`**: C equivalent of the Go/Python cryptographic
  suites, implementing all four protocols (HKEX, HSKE, HPKS, HPKE) with
  `FSCX_REVOLVE_N` and the full EVE bypass test suite. Uses 64-bit integers
  (`uint64_t`) and `/dev/urandom` for randomness.
  Build: `gcc -O2 -o "Herradura cryptographic suite" "Herradura cryptographic suite.c"`

- **`Herradura_tests.c`**, **`Herradura_tests.py`**, **`Herradura_tests.go`**:
  Security assumption tests and performance benchmarks, self-contained (no external
  dependencies). Tests run across 64/128/256-bit operand sizes (Python and Go) and
  64-bit (C), covering:
  1. FSCX_REVOLVE non-commutativity (expected: 0 / 10000 commutative pairs)
  2. FSCX single-step linear diffusion (expected: exactly 3 bits per flip —
     consequence of FSCX being a GF(2) linear map; L = Id ⊕ ROL ⊕ ROR)
  3. Orbit period (expected: period = P or P/2 for all random inputs)
  4. Bit-frequency balance (expected: each output bit set 47–53% of the time)
  5. HKEX session key XOR construction (expected: exactly 1-bit change per
     single-bit A flip — algebraic nonce cancellation property)
  Plus benchmarks for FSCX throughput, FSCX_REVOLVE throughput, full HKEX
  handshake, and HSKE round-trip (encrypt + decrypt).

### Changed
- **`Herradura cryptographic suite.go`** and **`Herradura cryptographic suite.py`**:
  replaced external `go-bitarray` / `bitstring` library dependencies with
  self-contained `BitArray` implementations backed by `math/big.Int` (Go) and
  Python `int` (Python), eliminating all third-party runtime dependencies.

- **`go.mod`** / **`go.sum`**: removed `github.com/tunabay/go-bitarray` dependency.

### Fixed
- **`Herradura cryptographic suite.go`** line 380: `%x` format argument was `V2`
  (a variable from the HSKE section) instead of `D2` (the HKEX public value for
  the EVE HPKE test). This caused the wrong value to be printed in the Eve HPKE
  output line.

### Mathematical notes
- FSCX(A,B) = FSCX(B,A) for all A, B (the formula is symmetric under swap).
  Non-commutativity arises only in FSCX_REVOLVE, where B is held constant across
  iterations.
- For FSCX as a polynomial over GF(2): `L(x) = (1 + t + t⁻¹)x`. By the Frobenius
  endomorphism, `L^(2^k) = 1 + t^(2^k) + t^(-2^k)`, so any power-of-2 step count
  (including i_value = P/4 when P is a power of 2) always produces exactly 3-bit
  single-step diffusion.
- In the HKEX XOR construction `sk = FSCX_REVOLVE_N(C2, B, hn, r) ⊕ A`, flipping
  one bit of A changes the session key by exactly 1 bit. The nonce term
  `S_r · L^i(e_k)` cancels algebraically to zero, leaving only the direct XOR
  contribution.

## [1.1] - 2026

### Added
- **`FSCX_REVOLVE_N`** primitive in `Herradura cryptographic suite` (Go and Python).
  Each iteration XORs a nonce N into the result:
  ```
  result = FSCX(result, B) ⊕ N
  ```
  This converts `FSCX_REVOLVE` from a purely GF(2)-linear function to an affine
  function, breaking per-step linearity while preserving the HKEX equality and
  orbit properties. See the [FSCX_REVOLVE_N section in the README](README.md)
  for the mathematical proof.

- **Session-specific nonce derivation** (no new secrets required):
  - HKEX, HPKS, HPKE: `hkex_nonce = C ⊕ C2`, computable from the public key
    since A2 and B2 are public (C2 = fscx_revolve(A2, B2, i)).
  - HSKE: nonce = preshared key, injecting the key at every revolve step rather
    than only at the input/output boundaries.

### Changed
- `Herradura cryptographic suite.go` and `Herradura cryptographic suite.py`:
  replaced all `fscx_revolve` calls (except the initial public-value generation
  of C and C2) with `fscx_revolve_n` using the appropriate nonce.
- Copyright year ranges updated across all source files to include 2026.

## [1.0] - 2024

### Added
- Initial release of `Herradura cryptographic suite` (Go and Python) implementing:
  - **HKEX** – key exchange in the style of Diffie-Hellman, using `FSCX_REVOLVE`.
  - **HSKE** – symmetric key encryption: `E = fscx_revolve(P, key, i)`;
    decrypt with `P = fscx_revolve(E, key, r)`.
  - **HPKS** – public key signature (must be composed with HSKE to be secure).
  - **HPKE** – public key encryption.
  - EVE bypass test suite covering all four protocols.

## Earlier history

### ARM assembly example – 2023
- Added `HKEX_arm_linux.s`: HKEX in ARM 32-bit assembly for Linux (Cortex-A7,
  thumb mode), runnable via QEMU.

### Bug fixes and cleanup – 2024
- Fixed `getMax` function in the C sample (`Herradura_KEx.c`).
- General code cleanup across C implementations.

### Python HKEX refactor – 2024
- Refactored `Herradura_KEx.py` for clarity and correctness (argument parsing,
  type hints, secure random generation with `secrets.randbits`).
